# Overview

This package implements methods for building a consensus molecular classification using existing classification systems. Functions implemented in this package were used for the Consensus Classifications of Colorectal and Bladder Cancer.

# Example

Three methods of reaching a consensus classification are implemented: COCA (Cluster of Clusters Analysis), MCL (Markov Cluster Algorithm) and CIT, which was used in Rebouiossou et. al.

All methods require the same input data, which is a `data.frame` with samples as observations (rows) and the different classification systems as variables (columns). 

As an example, we can use the table for the six classification systems in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(BuildConsensus)
data(blca_class)

head(blca_class, 8)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(BuildConsensus)
data(blca_class)
kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(head(blca_class, 8)), c("striped"))
```

## MCL algorithm

To run the MCL algorithm using `consensus.MCL`, the mcl library has to be installed in your system. For installation instructions, please refer to Github README file: https://github.com/cit-bioinfo/BuildConsensus/ 
The MCL algorithm itself is outlined in the algorithm website: https://micans.org/mcl/

Once the data is provided in the `data.frame` format described above, we can run the MCL algorithm by also specifying the inflation factors and the output directory. Multiple inflation factors can be evaluated in one run.

A simple example can be run using:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mcl_res <- consensus.MCL(blca_class, I.values = 3, outdir = "MCL_res",n.iter = 500, sim.method = "CohenKappa")
```

This inflation value for this dataset renders a K=4 solution, as seen below. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("MCL_res/Heatmap_I30.png")
```

When multiple inflation values are being compared, the silhouette vs inflation factor plot can guide the user towards selecting the optimal result.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("MCL_res/silhouette_vs_InflationFactor.png")
```

# Reproducing the MIBC BLCA Consensus

The Consensus Classes of MIBC were computed using the MCL algorithm and the parameters described below. **Warning:** this will take a long time to run.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mcl_res <- consensus.MCL(blca_class, I.values = seq(3, 15, 0.3), outdir = "../MCL_res", resamp = .8, n.iter = 500, sim.method = "CohenKappa", filter.ini = "fisher", ck.cut = 0)
```

Note that due to a random element, your solution may be differ slightly from the reported Consensus solution.
